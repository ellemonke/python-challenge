# python-challenge
In each of these challenges, I used Python and CSV python library to analyze various types of data including financial calculations, data formatting, word linting, and election results.

## PyBank
I analyzed sample Profit & Loss data from a CSV file, including when the greatest profit and loss change occurred. Results were both outputted to the terminal and saved in a text file.

## PyBoss
I took a data set of employee information and formatted it including date formatting, anonymizing social security numbers, looking up state abbreviations, etc. and exporting it into a new CSV file.

## PyParagraph
I created a simple word linter that can count the number of words, number of sentences, average words in a sentence, and average letters in a word per document. It could read any text file and account for special characters. 

## PyPoll
I processed a large data file of over 1 million voting records to tally a previously unknown list of election candidates, count votes per candidate and determine the winner.
